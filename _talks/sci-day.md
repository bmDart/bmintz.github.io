Most springs Dartmouth graduate students from all STEM departments hold a day of activities for local elementary through high school students and their families to come learn about science. 

I have participated in this each time it was held. The below lists my contributions each year.  

2024: co-led an activity with graduate students Benjamin Shapiro and James Schmidt on Error Correcting Codes. We introduced binary, and the 4,7-Hamming Code. Participants played a game of telephone with the code words to demonstrate how errors could be corrected. 

2023: co-led a workshop with graduate student Grant Molnar and Post Doc Longmei Shu, on the game of Hackenbush and the Surreal numbers. We handed out <a href='https://bmdart.github.io/bmintz.github.io//files/hackenbush-handout_science-day-2023.pdf'>packets</a> for participants to learn the rules, and how to associate game states to numbers.
