Every year, the Bridges Math Art Conference invites local families to a free public event with a variety of fun math activities. I participated in the 2024 Family Day, when I attended the conference. 

My activity was based on the <a href='https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2024/bridges2024-503.html#gsc.tab=0'>short paper</a> I submitted to, and <a href='https://bmdart.github.io/bmintz.github.io//files/ti-links_presention_final.pdf'>presented</a> at, the conference. Participants would play a game where they tangled a knot, or the unknot, and handed it to a friend 
to guess if it was a knot, or not (the unknot). This demonstrated the complexity of this question. For participants who were interested, I shared a <a href='https://bmdart.github.io/bmintz.github.io//files/Knot Notes_final 2.pdf'>packet</a> 
on knot invariants. The main activity was to <a href='https://bmdart.github.io/bmintz.github.io//files/ti-links_final.pdf'>assemble</a> Brunnian Links based on the modular system from the paper. 
I also prepared a <a href='https://bmdart.github.io/bmintz.github.io//files/ti-links_poster_final.pdf'>poster</a>

In addition to these, I exhibited some related art I made: <a href='https://bmdart.github.io/bmintz.github.io//portfolio/temari/'>temari balls</a> and <a href='https://bmdart.github.io/bmintz.github.io//portfolio/ti-links/'>laser cut polyhedra. </a>
