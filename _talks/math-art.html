<u>Title</u>: Mathematical Art </br>
<u>Abstract</u>: George Hart once said that "Math is the most abstract art," and indeed few people see the creativity and beauty in it that many mathematicians do. 
By combining mathematical ideas with traditional media like sculpture and music, the broader public can appreciate this artistic side of math. In this talk, we'll explore 
the uncountable ways art has been infused with math, from using DeBrujin's theorem to count the patterns in traditional Japanese braiding, to edible polyhedra and much more! </br>
