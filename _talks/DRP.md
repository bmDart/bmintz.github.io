The Mathematics <a href='https://math.dartmouth.edu/~drp/'>Directed Reading Prorgam</a> (DRP) at Dartmouth pairs undergraduate students with graduate or post-doc mentors to dive deeply into mathematics not normally seen in the classroom. Our goal was also to foster diversity in mathematics by engaging those with varying backgrounds, and provide a supportive environment.

<b>2024</b>: I co-ran the program, and supervised a project in Social Choice Theory with Pahal Ahuja. We followed most of "A Primer in Social Choice Theory" by Wulf Gaertner. 

<b>2023</b>: I supervised a project on Mathematical Art with Jamison Anderson. We discussed a range of subjects, including symmetry groups and the Cayley graph of a group.
