Mathematics is often seen as a dry, immutable field. But to mathematicians, it is creative and ever changing. Mathematical art is a great way to communicate this perspective to a broader 
audience.

I enjoy crafting in many media, and combining these with my love for mathematics. Below are links to galleries and descriptions of these works! I've also put together
