I've always been fascinated by <a href='https://mathcurve.com/courbes3d.gb/brunnien/brunnien.shtml'>Brunnian links</a>. They have the peculiar property of falling apart if any 
individual component is removed. As such, they are a wonderful metaphor for the complex, fragile connections that keep this world together. The above picture is an infinite example 
based on a system I developped for constructing arbitrarily complex Brunnian links based on modules. Specifically, a swirl of four bands is mirrored in every other square of a tessellation. 
The system is described in a <a href='https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2024/bridges2024-503.html#gsc.tab=0'>short paper</a> for the 2024 Bridges Math Art Conference. Essentially,  
modules with a swirl of k bands are in bijection with vertices of degree k in a graph, so this system allows one to translate any graph into a Brunnian link! I presented this as an 
activity in the Bridges Family Day activity (link to that page), Also link temari, put laser cut here? Maybe make those the cover image.
