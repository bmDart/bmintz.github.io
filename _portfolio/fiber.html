This is a cross stitch of a solution to the <a href='https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/DDMMx12.pdf'>Picture Hanging Puzzle</a>, which asks how you can having a picture on n 
nails where removing any one nail causes the picture to fall. It is intimately connected to Brunnian links, as each nail is effectively an unknot in the link. This is a symmetric 
presentation of a general construction, where loops can be passed through each other in such a way that they each depend on their neighbors to stay together. I've also made a wooden 
version with four removable pegs and a length of rope to tie around them.
